This function will ensure that milliseconds will consist of 6 digits, a requirement
for the timestamp format we're using (the MySQL DATETIME format). That value is in
fractional seconds, not milliseconds.

MySQL lets us set the preicion of these fractional seconds, which we set to the max,
at 6. This makes them equivalent to microseconds, which are three magnitudes of order
smaller than milliseconds.

Because the JavaScript getMilliseconds() function returns a three digit value, we
will need to append three zeroes, to convert from milliseconds to microseconds,
and then prepend a number of zeroes that will make the string 6 digits long, in
order to match the format expected by MySQL's DATETIME(6).
